**Upload Flow**

1. Presigned URL Request: 
   - The frontend requests a pre-signed URL from the backend.

2. Direct Upload: 
   - The frontend uploads the file directly to S3 using the pre-signed URL.

3. Distribute to CloudFront Storage (for caching):
   - The frontend (or backend) updates metadata, then generates a CloudFront URL for the file.
